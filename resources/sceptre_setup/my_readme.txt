Like all the files for Klann, Morrisv1, Morrisv2, and Xie were taken directly from the CRISPRi screens where they were originally run (in same folder that the FDR_01 results are). In each of those folders, can check the resources for the given screen

Also i renamed all "raw_perturb_status" files to "perturb_status"
