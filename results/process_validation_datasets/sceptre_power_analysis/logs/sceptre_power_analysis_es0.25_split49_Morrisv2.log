Setting up sceptre object for Disovery Analysis
The class of what's being assigned to the response matrix
Running discovery analysis
Note: If you are on a Mac laptop or desktop, consider setting `parallel = TRUE` to improve speed. Otherwise, keep `parallel = FALSE`.

Warning: The calibration check (`run_calibration_check()`) should be run before the discovery analysis.
